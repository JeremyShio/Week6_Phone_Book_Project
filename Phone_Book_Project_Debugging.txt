     1. When creating a contact as ' Test ' user, contact does not recieve a ' user_id '
          -- Value of ' user_id ' is ' NULL '
          -- Integer is not being given to contact but why?
          -- ' User(model) ' is set to have a relationship with ' Contact '
          -- ' Contact(model) ' foreign key is set to ' user.id '

     2. ' User feedback for -- No Contacts ' shows 2x
          -- Probably due to the bug above
          -- Is it because I have a 2x check for User's contacts in my code?
